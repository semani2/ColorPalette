# ColorPalette
A simple single view iOS application in Swift which lets the users play with the three primary 
colors to create infinite colors.

The app provides the user with three UISlider widgets. The user can play with the sliders
to generate a plethora of colors.

This app is to practice the concept of outlets and actions.

P.S This app is being done as part of the Udacity iOS Nanodegree.
